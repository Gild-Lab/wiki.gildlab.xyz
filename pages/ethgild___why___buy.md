- You believe that eventually all gilded ETH will want to be ungilded.
- You can buy low and sell high.
- You can LP on standard AMMs and collect fees with limited IL.
- Unlike algorithmic coins, there is real ETH behind every ETHg enforced and tracked by erc1155 tokens.
  Unlike pegged coins, there is no active management or explicit definition of what "high" or "low" should be - figure it out.
- ETHg is burned at 0.1% faster rate than the erc1155 so a sliver of ETH is trapped for every gilding.
- This should provide sustainable demand on the erc20 token, pushing the market price higher.
- As the market price of the erc20 drops the benefits of gilding become less and the incentives to ungild increases.
- The more ETHg that is bought or locked in contracts (e.g. an AMM), the more ETH is no longer ungildable.
- There is no explicit peg to arbitrage, but very cheap ETHg could quickly lead to a bank run on gilded ETH.
- The bank run brings the ETHg price *_up_* due to the overburn mechanism and standard AMM bonding curves.
